# UberEngine
A "minimalist" 2D SDL game engine. Also my starter C++ project.  
Uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) for graphics.  
Uses [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D) for physics.

## Example
`PhyTest.cpp` is a simple engine example.

## Compile
A simple testing compilation script is provided.  
The `SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer and Box2D` libraries are required.

## Features
* **Easy Collisions**
* **Music/Sound Manager**
* **GameCamera** included in `UE_utils` 

## TODO
* **Tilemaps**
* **More utilities**
