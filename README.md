# UberEngine
A "minimalist" 2D SDL game engine. Also my starter C++ project.  
Uses [SDL](https://www.libsdl.org) for graphics.  
Uses [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/Box2D) for physics.

## Example
`Examples/physics.cpp` is a simple physics example.  
`Examples/dino.cpp` is a animation and font example.  

## Compile
A simple testing compilation script is provided.  
The `SDL2, SDL2_image, SDL2_mixer, SDL2_ttf and Box2D` libraries are required.

## Features
* **Music/Sound Manager** included in `UE_audio`  
* **2D Physics** included in `UE_physics` powered by `Box2D`  
* **GameCamera** included in `UE_utils`   
* **TTF font support** included in `UE_utils`  

## TODO
* **Tilemaps**
* **More utilities**
